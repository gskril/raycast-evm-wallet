# EVM Wallet

Developer-focused Ethereum wallet

## Installation

This extension is not on the Raycast store (yet), so you'll have to install it manually.

1. Clone this repository
2. Launch the "Import Extension" command in Raycast ([deeplink](raycast://extensions/raycast/developer/import-extension))
3. Import the repository you cloned in step 1, then continue to "Open Manage Extensions" ([deeplink](raycast://extensions/raycast/developer/manage-extensions))
4. While the "EVM Wallet" extension is highlighted, select "Start Development" from the actions menu (âŒ˜B)

This will open a terminal session, install dependencies, and start a development server. You can keep this running to see your code changes live if you plan to contribute, or end the session. The extension will still be available in Raycast.
